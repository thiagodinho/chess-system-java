**# Chess Game**
This projetct is a chess game implemented in Java to be played in the terminal. The project utilizes object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and a layered development approach to ensure modularity and maintainability.

**## Requirements**
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A terminal with color support (e.g., Git Bash)

**## Installation and Setup**
1. Clone the repository to your local machine;
2. Navigate to the bin directory;
3. Run the program using the following command: java application/Program

**## How to Play**
Once you've launched the game, follow these steps to play:

1.  You will be prompted to enter the coordinates of the piece you want to move and the coordinates of the destination square.
2.  The game will validate your move based on the rules of chess.
3.  If the move is valid, the piece will be moved to the destination square, and it will be the opponent's turn.
4.  Continue making moves until checkmate.

**## Features**
-  Object-Oriented Design: The game is designed using OOP principles, with classes representing the game board, pieces, players, and more.
-  Layered Development: The project is structured in layers, separating the UI, game logic, and data layers to ensure clean and maintainable code.
-  Colorful Terminal Display: The game uses color codes to display the chessboard and pieces, making it visually appealing in supported terminals like Git Bash.
